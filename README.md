# Python Simple Deployment Demonstration

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a simple deployment using the venv module from the python standard library.

To install and execute this short demo, you need to follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/tchappui/py-deploy-demo.git && cd py-deploy-demo`
2. `python3 app.py` on macos/linux and `py -3 app.py` on windows

If the dependencies are not installed, a virtual environment is automatically created with 
the needed requirements installed inside.
